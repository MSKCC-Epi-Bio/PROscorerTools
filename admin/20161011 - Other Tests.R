# 20161011 - Other Tests.R

# Other tests to check before CRAN submission, 
#   and to eventually formally implement 

# - Check that chkstop_minmax() messages properly implement sprintf() when used 
#   within non-scoreScale functions (e.g., score_NARCC())

# - Check that score_NARCC returns data frame for all combos of  
#   whichScale and keepNvalid
