Description: Provides a set of reliable and flexible tools to score PRO, QoL, 
    and other psychometric measures.  The scoreScale function can be used 
    to score most single-scale measures.  Additionally, it and the other 
    PROscorerTools functions can be used together to write new functions 
    that score more complex measures.  The PROscorerTools functions are the 
    building blocks of the scoring functions in the PROscorer package.  Users 
    are encouraged to use PROscorerTools to write scoring functions for their 
    favorite PRO-like instruments, and to submit these functions for inclusion 
    in PROscorer (a tutorial vignette will be added soon).  The long-term 
    vision for the PROscorerTools and PROscorer packages is to provide an 
    easy-to-use system to facilitate the incorporation of PRO measures into 
    research studies in a scientifically rigorous and reproducible manner.  
    These packages and their vignettes are intended to help establish and 
    promote "best practices" for scoring and describing PRO-like measures in 
    research.  The current version is still somewhat developmental, since the 
    formal unit testing system is not yet in place.  Please use with caution 
    at this time, and feel free to contact me with questions or suggestions.
